## Introduction
[Notice](https://notice.studio) allows you to create Blog, Documentation, Help Center, FAQs, Terms and Conditions, Whitepapers, Job Boards, single Articles, and so on. In 1 minute, you can get started with our template or AI.

Notice handles translations, SEO, analytics, collaboration. It's a cross-platform page builder, a new kind of web component dedicated to content. You can use our [API](https://notice-api.readme.io/reference/get-published-block) to get more flexibility with integrating Notice, and use us as a headless CMS.
